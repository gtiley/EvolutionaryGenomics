In participating in this class, I agree to treat all members of the group with respect and honesty.  I also agree to contribute to the group-learning experience with sincerity and enthusiasm.  I am committed to the Socratic ideal of cooperative dialogue among individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.
