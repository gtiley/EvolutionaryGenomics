We are an inclusive group with the goal of creating an intelectually stimulating environment supporting graduate research and skill buidling. Everybody will be shown the respect, dignity, and dedicated the time to meet their learning goals. Participants will often work in pairs or groups to faciliate real-time analysis and collegiality. All participants will treat other members with respect and be expected give their undivided attention during class and share responsibilities equally.
