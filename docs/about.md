We are focused on the practical knowledge and skill building to perform many analyses in genomics or that use genomic data.
This will sometimes be statistical theory or computing adjacent, but we will often accept convention as corollaries. This does not mean that what is popular should not be challenge though, only that we are limited on time.
Coding examples will be provided throughout the course where appropriate, but keep in mind there are often many solutions and you should leverage languages and coding styles that are of most benefit to you.
