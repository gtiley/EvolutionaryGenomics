Our first day is simply making sure everybody has the basic tools to participate in the course. There are three goals today:
1. Log on to the DCC cluster
2. Perform basic UNIX operations
3. Run some scripts

There may be some necessary downloads for your own computers in order to log onto the cluster and edit files.
* Windows
+ [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
+ [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.1.html)
* Mac
+ [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)

More downloads will arise as the course progresses. If you are on a Mac, I recommend download the command line tools from the developer [website](https://developer.apple.com/). Windows users - we will have to work on a more piecemeal solution.
